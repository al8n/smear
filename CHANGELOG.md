# Changelog

All notable changes to Smear are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

- `smear-lexer`: string literals in byte sources (`[u8]`, `Bytes`, `BStr`,
  `HipByt`) must be well-formed UTF-8. Ill-formed content is refused with
  `StringError::UnsupportedCharacter`, carrying each sequence's span.
  `LitStr::try_from(&[u8])` refuses likewise. `str` and `HipStr` sources are
  unchanged (#246).
- `smear-lexer`: comments in byte sources (`[u8]`, `Bytes`, `BStr`, `HipByt`)
  must be well-formed UTF-8. Both the syntactic and the lossless lexer refuse an
  ill-formed comment with one `LexerErrorData::UnknownLexeme` per ill-formed
  sequence, at that sequence's span, and consume the whole comment; the lossless
  error token covers the whole comment. `str` and `HipStr` sources are unchanged
  (#251).
- `smear-schema`: `SchemaErrorKind::UnreadableText` is no longer reachable from
  a parsed document. The kind is kept.
- Builds on tokora 0.12 and smol-bytes 0.2. Paths through the
  `smear::lexer::tokora` re-export follow tokora 0.12's layout. The `smol-bytes`
  feature of `smear`, `smear-lexer` and `smear-parser` now enables tokora's
  `smol-bytes_0_2` integration instead of `smol_bytes_0_1`, so the four
  smol-bytes source types are smol-bytes 0.2's. Supersedes #235.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-10-30

- Coordinated the first `0.0.1` release of the six publishable crates:
  `smear-lexer`, `smear-parser`, `smear-schema`, `smear-compiler`,
  `graphql-proto`, and `smear`.
